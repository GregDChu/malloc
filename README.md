A reimplementation of C's memory allocation functions for learning purposes. This library was originally implemented on a unix server.

* Run 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib:./lib64:./libstd:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' to append the local malloc library to the standard library search path\
* Run 'make' to build the program
* enter './main' to test the custom malloc library
